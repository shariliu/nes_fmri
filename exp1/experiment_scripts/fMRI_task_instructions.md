You will be asked to view movies and answer simple questions about them in the fMRI scanner. The scan plus setup time will last about 2 hours. You will receive $30/hour for your participation.

If you are interested, please reply to shariliu@mit.edu with answers to all of the below questions.

We often get many replies to these messages, so if we do not write back to confirm, it means the slots have already been filled. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,

Shari

1. Name, date of birth, and sex
2. Time slot preferences. Please list all that you are available
3. Have you previously done fMRI, if so with who?
4. Cell phone number (or best number to reach you on the day of the scan)
5. Handedness (right or left)
6. Do you fulfill these requirements? (Please respond individually)

  a)  do NOT not have any metal in your body (pacemaker, aneurysm clips, metal dental work, etc) or non-removable metal jewelry/ piercings

  b) do not experience claustrophobia

  c) have normal or corrected vision (please let us know in advance if you wear glasses, we will need your prescription if you don't have contacts!)

  d) are between the ages of 18-40 (please provide actual age):

  e) can lie still for approx. 2 hours

  f) do not have neurological diseases or conditions


### Confirmation
Hello,

Great! You are scheduled for ________. I will meet you in the lobby of the McGovern Institute at 524 Main Street in Cambridge. You can enter via the the door on Main Street near the tall tornado-like statue - if the door is locked, feel free to call or text me and I can let you in. Please confirm by responding to this email that you can still make it at the scheduled time.

Keep in mind that you cannot be wearing any metal, including any jewelry or metal in undergarments, etc, and you should come with no makeup (namely mascara / eyeliner). We will provide scrubs for you at the time of the study. If you have corrected-to-normal vision, we prefer that you wear contacts to your appointment. If you wear glasses and cannot wear contacts for the study, please let us know your prescription so that we can prepare scanner-safe glasses for you.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,

Shari

## Consenting Script

### About the study
People have expectations about the world (objects are solid). In this study, we want to know which regions of the brain track these expectations and also track violations of those expectations. 

### About fMRI
The MRI machine uses strong magnet and radio waves to take pictures of your brain. You will not feel these waves, but you will hear repetitive noises from the scanner. We will give you earphones to protect your hearing. 

It is really important that we know about all metals and electronic devices that are on or in your body. Metal objects must be removed before entering the scanner room. We will give you a form where we will screen for possible metals and other conditions. Happy to discuss specific cases when we get to the form. 

### What we're doing today
Before we go into the scanner, we will ask you to change into surgical scrubs. We will give you a locker and key to store your belongings. 

You will lie back on a long cushion, and watch short animated movies, and respond using buttons. (Will say more right before each task.) Time in the MRI machine should be about an hour. 

While you're in the MRI, we'll either be (1) actively collecting data from your brain, or (2) pausing to set up the next task. Once you get into the MRI, it is really important to be still. Even 1 millimeter could blur the images, and there's lots of ways to move 1 mm (shifting your arm or leg, swallowing, coughing). I'm not saying you can't swallow or cough, or scratch an itch, if you really need to, but if you can hold on until the rest period that would be great. 

We'll check in with you during rest periods to see how you're doing. If you're feeling sleepy, that's ok - let us know, and we can do some trivia. During the data collection periods, the scanner is really loud, so if you need to talk to us urgently (emergency, you want to stop the study), give you a button to press. This is for 'I need to stop immediately'. 

For people who are very tall or lanky, it's possible that they'll feel a little tingling in their hands or feet. This is totally normal and harmless. But if you ever feel heat, burning, let us know right away. This can be caused by closed loops, so when we get you set up we'll make sure your arms and legs aren't crossed, and no wires are crossed. 

Afterwards, we will give you a few pictures of your brain, and process your payment. You will be paid $30 per hour. Would you prefer an Amazon gift card or a check? 

### Presenting the form
If you would still like to particpate, here are a few forms to fill out.

1. Consent statement saying that you understand the information we went over, and agree to participate. (Be sure to offer a copy of this form.)

2. Data sharing form. Scientists benefit when we share fMRI data with each other. Your name, head shape, date, etc would not be associated with your name. This is optional - please sign either way, and write that you do or don't want to share.

3. COVID form, confirming that you do not currently have COVID and do not have a high risk of having COVID. 

4. MRI screening form. Please make sure to read and circle each individual item on the list. If you circle yes, that doesn't necessarily mean you can't participate - we just need to talk about it and make a note. Read the bottom statement carefully. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

## Step by step after forms, before scanning
- Check consent forms for signatures and correct dates. 
- Provide scrubs, socks and scanner safe mask (double check that there's NO nose wire), show participant lockers.
- Visually check whether jewelery was removed, etc. Verify that participant is cool re: bathroom.
- Take participant through metal detector. Have them spin around at least twice.
- Register patient (format SAX_NES_sxxx) in the system.
- Have participant choose a Scout/T1 video, and pull up the video.
- Bring participant into scan room. Have them put in headphones (verify sound is very muffled), place earmuffs over those, lie back in coil. Place supplmeental pillows around coil if needed. Give leg rest. Tape down each earphone wire to leg. Show button box and tape down (right hand). Show squeeze ball and tape down (left hand). 
- Verify that participant's arms and legs aren't crossed. Ask if they'd like to adjust. Verify that they'd be able to stay still like this for an hour.
- Place top head coil. Lift up scan bed and send partially in. Use laser to do landmark alignment (have participant close eyes and place hand over their eyes). Place mirror and make sure participant can see all 4 corners of the screen.
- Before sending them in, say that we'll talk to them through their headphones in a few seconds from the control room.
- Send participant in, head to control room, check in right away. Check that volume of Scout/T1 video is ok.
- Right before scout - remind participant to try to be as still as possible from now on.

## What to check for and do during the scan

### Scout and T1
- Does it look like a brain or does it all look messed up? Is the bounding box in the right place? If image looks weird will need to rerun (cancel next task, drag task down from the list to repeat).

### Functional runs
- Beginning of each run: Did the trigger start the stim presentation? If not, stop the run, unplug / re-plug the USB cable, test it, and rerun.
- Motion: Scrolling through the TRs, is the image moving? A tiny bit every once in a while is totally fine. A tiny bit (or more motion), often, will be flagged for exclusion. Say to participant during next break that there's some motion, remind to try to be as still as possible.
- After 2-3 functional runs, or if participant isn't responding to attention checks, check to see if they're sleepy and want to do some trivia before continuing. 
- Heuristic: all runs (except for Scout) are 8 minutes or under.

### Miscellaneous
Make a copy of screener form, place original in folder in control room.


## Task instructions for VOESocPhys and DotsSocPhys

### VOESocPhys
In this task, you'll watch animated videos. Please pay attention to the videos. In between, there will be fixation crosses that sometimes looks like a plus sign (+) and others that look like the letter x. Use your index finger to press the button one time whenever you see the x. You will also see a black frame at the end of the task - that is to be expected.  

### DotsSocPhys
In this task, you'll watch animated videos of two dots moving. Please pay attention. In the middle of the video, one of the dots will become invisible for a few seconds. Your job is to imagine how the hidden dot was behaving during the 2 s when it was invisible. As soon as the dot reappears, report whether it is in a correct location index finger) or wrong location (middle finger). You only have about a second to respond, so make a judgment as soon as the dot reappears. See a black frame in the start middle and end - that is to be expected.
