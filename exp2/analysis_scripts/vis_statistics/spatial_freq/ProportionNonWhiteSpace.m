%   For isolated object images, calculate how much of the image isn't the
%   white background. This is useful for comparison of image sets to ensure
%   one doesn't just have objects of larger retinal size than the other.
%
%   Note: also counts white objects as background, not very sophisticated!
%   Though this would not be a trivial issue to fix. This should be good
%   enough for comparing image sets, since one image isn't going to throw
%   off the statistics.
%
%   Usage:
%       [propnonwhite] = ProportionNonWhiteSpace(folder);
%       Ex: propnonwhite = ProportionNonWhiteSpace('images/');
%
%   Inputs:
%   folder = folder containing the set of images.
%
%   Outputs:
%   propnonwhite = a vector with the proportion of non-white space for each
%   of the images in the directory.

diry = [dir([folder '*.jpg']) ;dir([folder '*.jpeg']) ;dir([folder '*.tif']) ;dir([folder '*.tiff']) ;dir([folder '*.bmp'])]; 

Nimages = length(diry);

for i = 1:Nimages
    imname{i} = diry(i).name;
    img = imread([folder imname{i}]);
    imgsize = size(img,1)*size(img,2);
    white = length(img((img(:,:,1)==255) & (img(:,:,2)==255) & (img(:,:,3)==255)));
    propnonwhite(i) = 1- white / imgsize;
end
