%   Usage:
%       [Ef Qhf] = CalculateSpectraEnergy(folder... level, hfci, displayFig)
%       Ex: [Ef Qhf] = CalculateSpectraEnergy('imageFolder/',80,10,true);
%           [Ef Qhf] = CalculateSpectraEnergy('imageFolder/');
% 
%   folder = folder containing the set of images.
%   level = level of energy you want to look at (from 1 to 100%). Default
%       is 80.
%	hfci = cycle/image value for calculating the quantity of HSF > hfci.
%       Default is 10.
%	displayFig = true if you want to see the spatial frequency figure,
%       false if not. Default is true.

% CALCULATE IMAGE ENERGY: Ef
% level is a number between 0 and 100: e.g. level of energy 80%
%
% returns 'Ef' which is the frequency that contains the specified amount of
% energy in cycle/image.
% e.g. Ef = 3 c/i is very low spatial frequency. 
%
% CALCULATE QUANTITY OF HSF: Qhf
% hfci is a number between 1 c/i to the maximum frequency (image
% size/2): e.g. 10
% return Qhf, which is the % of HSF above "hfci" image/cycle

% NOTE: IMAGES TO COMPARE MUST ALL HAVE THE SAME SIZE
